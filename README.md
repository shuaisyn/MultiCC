## What is MultiCC?

**MultiCC** is a self-hosted orchestration layer that turns your locally-installed AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) into a multi-client, multi-session platform. Start a task on your laptop, monitor it from your phone, and get notified on IM when it finishes — all against the same persistent sessions.

It was built around four observations:

1. **Agent sessions should outlive the client.** Close your laptop mid-task; pick it up from your phone. MultiCC keeps terminal sessions in `tmux` and chat sessions as stateful turns — disconnects never kill progress.
2. **One interface can't serve every moment.** Full terminal when you're at the desk, chat bubbles on the go, push notifications when you're away. MultiCC ships all three against one backend.
3. **Multiple agents work better than one.** Run Claude and Codex sessions side-by-side in the same repo, each isolated in its own git worktree. Dispatch tasks across sessions, merge results back.
4. **Voice is the fastest input on a phone.** Dictate in Chinese or English, let Whisper transcribe and an LLM polish it into a precise prompt. The system learns your project's jargon over time. New: talk to your agents like a phone call with real-time speech-to-speech.

## vs. the ecosystem

The open-source ecosystem around Claude Code and Codex has grown fast. Below is a survey of projects that **harness** these CLIs (spawn, manage, and route the official binaries) rather than replace them.

> **Standalone coding agents** like [OpenCode](https://github.com/naklecha/opencode), [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider), and [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) implement their own agent loop — they're alternatives to Claude Code, not orchestration layers on top. They're excluded from this comparison.

### The CLI harness landscape

| Project | Stars | Architecture | Drives | What it solves |

"I want to bridge my agents to IM"                     → cc-connect
"I want to route multiple CLIs through one API"        → CLIProxyAPI

"I want a self-hosted server that turns my AI coding
 agents into a persistent, multi-client, scheduled,
 notifiable, voice-enabled, IM-connected service"      → MultiCC
```

### Head-to-head: orchestration harnesses that drive both Claude Code + Codex

### Where MultiCC is unique

MultiCC is the only project in this list that is a **self-hosted server** rather than a desktop app or CLI tool. This architectural choice unlocks its differentiators:

1. **Always-on, headless operation.** Runs on your Mac mini / Linux box / VPS. No desktop needed. Agents keep working after you close your laptop.
2. **Multi-client per session.** Web, Flutter app, and IM bridges can all attach to the same session simultaneously — output fans out to all.
3. **IM-native.** Five IM bridges (WeChat, Feishu, Telegram, Discord, Slack) with bidirectional relay and `<<dispatch>>` confirmation. cc-connect does bridging only; MultiCC does bridging + orchestration.
4. **Scheduled & autonomous work.** Cron jobs with persistent context, wait/poll auto-resume, run-detached background tasks — agents continue without human nudges.
5. **Voice.** S2S real-time voice (VAD → ASR → LLM → TTS → barge-in) and classic STT with vocabulary learning. No other harness offers voice.
6. **Per-session provider isolation.** One session on Claude Max, another on DeepSeek, no env bleed. Other tools switch globally or don't manage providers.

### Where MultiCC is weaker

- **No desktop IDE integration.** Superset and Orca offer diff viewers, inline editing, and IDE handoff. MultiCC's terminal is xterm.js in a browser — no native editor integration.
- **No SSH remote worktrees.** Orca supports running agents on a remote beefy machine via SSH. MultiCC runs everything on the server host.
- **No native GUI app.** cc-switch and AionUi are polished desktop apps. MultiCC is a web server (by design, but some users prefer a native app).
- **Smaller community.** The projects above have 10k–111k stars. MultiCC is newer and less known.
- **No swarm framework.** Ruflo offers 100+ specialized agents, self-learning memory, and federation. MultiCC's cross-session dispatch is simpler and more manual.

## Features

### Two modes, one backend

| Mode | UI | Backend |
|------|----|---------|
| **Terminal** (`/`) | Full `xterm.js` — scrollback, colors, input, resize | `tmux` session, `pipe-pane` + named FIFO for reliable output |
| **Chat** (`/chat`) | Message bubbles with streaming tool cards, image previews | Claude Code `stream-json` or Codex `exec --json` — events normalized over WebSocket |

Both modes share the same session registry, auth, and notifications. Reconnect replays the last 500 stream events so you never see a half-empty conversation.

### Multi-provider support

Each session picks its own CLI (`claude` or `codex`) and an optional provider — one session can use the official Claude subscription while another routes through DeepSeek via a custom endpoint.

| CLI | Terminal mode | Chat mode | Provider isolation |
|-----|---------------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude` inside `tmux`, resumed by session id | `claude -p --output-format stream-json` | Per-session `ANTHROPIC_*` env vars; clean default login for sessions without a provider override |
| **Codex** | `codex` / `codex resume <id>` inside `tmux` | `codex exec --json` | Per-provider `CODEX_HOME` under `~/.multicc/codex-homes`; local proxy for non-OpenAI endpoints |

- Providers are managed from `/manage` or the provider API — create, edit, import from `cc-switch`, set per-CLI defaults.
- **Per-session model selection**: each session can override the provider's default model; the chat UI shows a model picker with provider-specific options.
- **Provider-aware model options**: custom providers expose their own model lists (e.g., DeepSeek, GLM, Qwen) via `modelOptions`.

### Session orchestration

- **Git worktree isolation.** Each normal session runs in `<repo>/.multicc-worktrees/<sessionId>` on branch `multicc/<sessionId>`. Parallel agents edit safely; merge/sync APIs move changes between session branches and the base branch.
- **Agent Commander.** Every new directory is seeded with an Agent Commander chat session — a fleet conductor that can coordinate specialized sibling sessions. Comes with role presets for common agent profiles.
- **Cross-session dispatch.** Any chat session can emit `<<dispatch target="SESSION_ID">...</dispatch>>`; MultiCC runs the task on the target session and injects the result back. IM bridges use the same mechanism with explicit confirmation.
- **Passive inter-agent notes.** Sessions leave notes for siblings in the same directory; notes are prepended to the target agent's next chat turn.
- **Syntax-gated merges.** Merge is rejected if a session's changes introduce JS syntax errors — broken code can't reach the base branch.
- **Auto-commit + auto-sync.** Sessions auto-commit before merging; sibling worktrees auto-sync after a merge so everyone stays current.

### Long-running & scheduled work

- **Wait/poll.** Agents register poll or callback waits; MultiCC injects results back into the chat session when the condition resolves — no human nudge needed.
- **`run-detached`.** Long builds, tests, deploys run with `setsid` outside the session lifecycle. Completion auto-registers a wait and sends exit code + output tail back.
- **Cron jobs.** Recurring tasks with standard 5-field cron expressions, each owning a persistent chat session so context carries across runs.
- **Per-session auto-triggers.** Post-turn, file-change, and schedule triggers wake sessions automatically, with cooldowns and manual test firing.
- **Progress-friendly defaults.** The system prompt steers agents toward `run-detached` or explicit waits instead of fragile background shell jobs.

### Speech-to-Speech (S2S) real-time voice

Talk to your agents like a phone call — the newest voice mode:

- **Real-time VAD** (Voice Activity Detection) with RMS-based adaptive noise floor — speaks when you speak, listens when you listen.
- **Streaming ASR** sends audio chunks as you talk; recognition fires automatically on silence.
- **LLM confirmation** refines the recognized text into a structured task list; you confirm with a tap or "yes."
- **Streaming TTS** reads the agent's reply aloud as it arrives; supports Edge TTS (free), OpenAI TTS, and 火山引擎 TTS.
- **Barge-in interrupt**: start speaking and the agent stops talking — ~60ms response.
- **Progress summaries**: the agent gives spoken status updates during long tasks.

Powered by: `public/s2s-session.js` (state machine), `public/vad-monitor.js` (VAD), `public/voice-output.js` (TTS player), `src/tts-service.js` (server-side TTS).

### Voice input (classic mode)

- **Whisper STT** through any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Groq, OpenRouter, self-hosted).
- **AI refinement** streams raw text through an LLM and replaces filler with precise technical language — delivered over SSE.
- **Vocabulary learning loop.** Accepted corrections feed into `whisper_vocab.json` and are sent as the Whisper `prompt` parameter — the system gets better at your project's jargon over time.

### Multi-client per session

- Multiple browser tabs, phones, and the Flutter app can attach to the same session and see output in sync.
- **Reconnect replay**: a rolling buffer of 500 stream events backfills chat bubbles on reconnect — never see a half-empty conversation after waking the screen.
- **Persistent chat history**: every message is stored in `chat_history/<sessionId>.json` with token counts and timing.

### Token usage & cost tracking

- **Per-provider stats**: daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time token counts for every provider (Claude, Codex, custom endpoints).
- **Per-session breakdown**: each chat message shows input/output tokens and provider attribution.
- **Global usage panel**: `/manage` shows cumulative token usage across all sessions, including Codex session tokens from `~/.codex/sessions`.
- **Live display**: the chat header bar shows per-provider token consumption in real time.

### Notifications

Five delivery channels, triggered when the agent finishes or needs input — and only when you're not actively watching:

| Channel | Reach | Use case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Web Push (VAPID)** | Any browser / PWA | Laptop in another room, phone in your pocket |
| **Bark** | iOS `Bark` app | Reliable iOS push without Apple certs |
| **Webhook** | Any HTTP endpoint | Pipe into Slack, Lark, n8n, Home Assistant |
| **In-app voice alert** | Browser `speechSynthesis` | "Task completed" speaks aloud at your desk |
| **Flutter local notification** | Android notification tray | Lock-screen alerts when the app is backgrounded |

### Multi-IM bridges

MultiCC can be your agents' gateway to the world — reply from WeChat, Feishu, Telegram, Discord, or Slack:

| Bridge | Transport | Gateway session | Setup |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **WeChat** (iLink) | PC WeChat API | `__gateway__` | iLink WeChat plugin |
| **Feishu / Lark** | Open Platform long-connection | `__feishu_gateway__` | App ID + Secret in `/manage` |
| **Telegram** | Bot API long-polling | `__telegram_gateway__` | Bot token from @BotFather |
| **Discord** | Gateway WebSocket | `__discord_gateway__` | Bot token + intents |
| **Slack** | Socket Mode | `__slack_gateway__` | App token + bot token |

All bridges support:
- Bidirectional relay between IM and a MultiCC chat session.
- `<<dispatch>>` with explicit confirmation — the agent proposes a task, you confirm in-chat, and the result flows back.
- Live SSE log stream in the browser UI.
- Start/stop controls and credential management from `/manage`.

### Flutter native app

A real Flutter app (Android + iOS), not a wrapped webview:

- **Multi-session sidebar** with swipe-to-close, unread badges, and per-session working directory.
- **xterm terminal widget** and a custom chat UI with message bubbles, tool cards, and inline images.
- **Background notifications** via `flutter_local_notifications` + the server's push pipeline.
- **In-app APK auto-update**: checks the server's `/multicc.apk` mtime, offers one-tap install.
- **Voice capture** with waveform visualization.
- **Task progress scroller** on the home screen showing real-time session status.
- **KPI dashboard**: active sessions, waiting sessions, cron jobs — all tappable for drill-down.
- **Directory management**: drag-to-reorder, compact preview cards, detail sheets.

### Web dashboard (`/manage`)

A single operational surface for everything:

- **Directory workspace view**: session counts, git push status, merge state, real-time activity indicators.
- **Session cards** with status (idle/completed/thinking/editing/running/waiting/error), cwd, provider, client count, last activity, and rainbow border animation when active.
- **Task progress scroller**: live scrolling feed of what each session is doing — shown on the home page.
- **Inline terminal**: click a session card to open its terminal in a large modal — no new tabs needed.
- **Session creation wizard**: multi-step flow (name → role preset → provider → model → create) with provider-aware model options.
- **Git worktree management**: view ahead/behind/conflict state, sync from base, merge to base, push base branch — all one-click.
- **Provider management**: import from `cc-switch`, create/edit/delete local providers, set CLI defaults, switch per-session.
- **Cron job panel**: create, edit, disable, manually run, and delete recurring tasks.
- **Wait/detached task inspector**: see what's pending and what's running in the background.
- **Public tunnel toggle**: enable Tailscale Funnel or monitor 花生壳 DDNS for external access.
- **QR code**: LAN IP + access token for instant phone onboarding.
- **APK download**: latest Flutter build served directly from the dashboard.
- **Onboarding tour**: mask-based guided walkthrough for new users.

### Session sharing

- Share selected chat messages as a **read-only snapshot link** — perfect for showing results to teammates.
- Optional password protection and operation permission.
- Shared sessions render with the same message bubbles and tool cards as the original.

### i18n (Internationalization)

- Both web UI and Flutter app support **Chinese (zh)** and **English (en)**.
- Language is auto-detected from the browser or app locale; toggle available in settings.
- All UI strings, status labels, error messages, and notifications are translated.

### Public access (tunnel)

- **Tailscale Funnel**: one-click toggle in `/manage` to expose your MultiCC server to the public internet via Tailscale.
- **花生壳 (phtunnel) monitor**: optional shell watchdog that restarts the DDNS client if the public URL goes unreachable.
- Both tunnel modes are managed from the dashboard with live status indicators.

### Security

- Optional `ACCESS_TOKEN` gates every API/WebSocket endpoint.
- `multicc_auth` HTTP-only cookie for sticky browser sessions.
- Localhost connections bypass the token.
- Self-signed HTTPS cert auto-generated with SAN entries for every local IP; auto-renewed when your IP changes (required for microphone + PWA).

### Server resilience

- **Port auto-selection**: if the configured port is occupied, MultiCC picks the next available one and logs it.
- **Graceful shutdown**: drains in-flight chat turns on SIGTERM/SIGINT instead of dropping them.
- **Crash recovery**: TTS service handles missing binaries gracefully; VAPID keys auto-generate on first run.
- **Syntax-gated merges**: JS files are validated before merging into the base branch.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsjwzh/MultiCC/main/install.sh | bash
```

Detects your OS, checks prerequisites, clones the repo, installs dependencies, configures an access token, and optionally installs as a background service (macOS `launchd`).

**Install with options:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsjwzh/MultiCC/main/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --port 8080 --token mysecrettoken --no-service
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dir <path>` | Install directory (default: `./MultiCC`) |
| `--token <xxx>` | Pre-set `ACCESS_TOKEN` (default: auto-generated) |
| `--port <port>` | Server port (default: `3000`) |
| `--no-service` | Skip background service install |
| `--no-clone` | Use current directory; skip git clone |
| `--branch <name>` | Git branch to clone (default: `main`) |

**After install:**

```bash
cd MultiCC && ./multicc start     # start the server
cd MultiCC && ./multicc install   # install as macOS launchd background service
```

**Update anytime:** `./multicc update` — pulls latest code, reinstalls deps if `package.json` changed, and restarts.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.19 (required by `chokidar` 5 ESM — backported `require(ESM)` support landed in Node 20.19 / 22.12)
- **tmux** (for terminal mode; chat mode works without it)
- **Claude Code CLI** — `claude` on your `PATH`, already logged in
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** — `codex` on your `PATH` (optional; only needed for Codex sessions)
- **Flutter** >= 3.8 (optional; only if building the native app yourself)

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lsjwzh/MultiCC.git
cd MultiCC
npm install
node server.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/chat` to begin. Other devices on the same LAN: `http://<your-lan-ip>:3000?token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>` (find the token in `.env`).

### CLI Service Manager

```bash
./multicc start       # start server (auto-picks next port if 3000 is taken)
./multicc stop        # stop server
./multicc restart     # restart server
./multicc status      # check if running
./multicc log         # tail live logs
./multicc update      # pull latest, reinstall deps, restart
./multicc install     # install launchd agent (macOS auto-start on login)
./multicc uninstall   # remove launchd agent
```

**Linux systemd user service:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/multicc.service <<'UNIT'
[Unit]
Description=MultiCC Server
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=$(which node) $PWD/server.js
WorkingDirectory=$PWD
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
UNIT
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now multicc
```

### Build the Flutter App

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release              # Android
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign # iOS (needs Xcode + signing)
```

The release APK is available in `app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` and served by the dashboard at `/multicc.apk`.

---

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables in `.env`. Voice and TTS settings hot-reload when edited via the dashboard UI. Provider configuration is managed through `/manage` or the provider API.

### How a message flows

**Terminal mode:**

```
browser keystroke → ws → tmux send-keys → claude → tmux pipe-pane → FIFO → ws → xterm render
```

**Chat mode:**

```
user message
  → ws → server.js (CLI + provider abstraction)
  → claude stream-json or codex exec --json [resume/session id]
  → stdout JSON events normalized through src/chat-stream.js
  → buffered (last 500 events) for reconnect replay
  → fan-out to all attached clients (web + Flutter)
  → chat bubble render with live tool cards, inline images, token stats
```

**S2S voice mode:**

```
microphone → VAD (vad-monitor.js) → streaming ASR → LLM confirmation →
user "yes" → agent runs task → streaming TTS reads reply aloud →
user interrupts by speaking → agent stops → next turn
```

### Key design decisions

- **tmux for terminal, raw spawn for chat.** Terminal needs persistent TTY state that survives disconnects. Chat is turn-based — the server spawns the CLI per turn, relying on Claude `--resume` or Codex `exec resume` for continuity.
- **Provider isolation per child process.** Claude providers inject `ANTHROPIC_*` env vars only for that session's spawn. Codex providers materialize separate `CODEX_HOME` directories. The server strips any leaked env vars at startup.
- **Worktree-first concurrency.** Each session owns a branch + worktree. Merge/sync APIs move changes between session branches and the base branch — no shared mutable checkout.
- **No database.** All state is in-memory `Map` objects persisted to flat JSON files. Fast, debuggable, no migration headaches.
- **Single auth layer.** `ACCESS_TOKEN` → HTTP-only `multicc_auth` cookie → applied uniformly to REST, WebSocket, and static files (JS/CSS exempted for login-page rendering).
- **Reconnect-safe chat.** Every WebSocket connect replays buffered events before going live, so the client deterministically rebuilds its bubble state.
- **Reliable continuation.** `wait`, `run-detached`, cron, and dispatch all re-enter a chat session through the same managed turn path — long-running work never gets lost between turns.
- **Syntax-gated merges.** Merge into the base branch is rejected if any `.js` file has syntax errors — broken code can't corrupt the shared branch.
- **Serialized git operations.** Concurrent git commands from multiple polled endpoints are queued through `src/git-queue.js` to prevent race conditions.

## FAQ

### "Certificate warning" on first visit

Expected. MultiCC generates a self-signed cert for HTTPS (required for microphone + PWA). Click **Advanced** → **Proceed** once per device.

### Claude command not found

MultiCC searches common install paths on startup. If it still can't find `claude`:

```bash
echo 'CLAUDE_CMD=/path/to/claude' >> .env
```

### Codex command not found

MultiCC searches Homebrew, local-bin, Cargo, and shell PATH. If needed:

```bash
echo 'CODEX_CMD=/path/to/codex' >> .env
```

### Which provider does a session use?

Each session records `cli` (`claude` or `codex`) and an optional `provider` id. If `provider` is empty, the session uses the local default login. If set, only that session's spawned process gets the provider override — siblings can use different providers safely. Check `/manage` → session card for the active provider.

### How do I switch a session's model?

On `/manage`: click the session card → "Model" dropdown shows provider-specific options. On the chat page: the model picker is in the header bar. Switching a session's provider automatically clears the model override so the new provider's default takes effect.

### "此浏览器不支持录音" (Browser doesn't support recording)

`MediaRecorder` requires a secure context. Make sure you're on `https://` (or `http://localhost`) and have accepted the self-signed certificate.

### How do I use S2S (speech-to-speech) real-time voice?

1. Install `edge-tts` (Python): `pip install edge-tts`
2. Install `ffmpeg`: `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Linux)
3. In the chat page, click the phone icon to start a voice session
4. Speak naturally; the system will confirm your request, then the agent runs and reads its reply aloud
5. Interrupt by speaking — the agent stops and listens

### Flutter app can't reach the server from my phone

- Check the phone is on the same LAN.
- Open `https://<your-ip>:3000` in the phone's browser first and accept the cert.
- Confirm `ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in the Flutter setup screen if the server has one.

### How do I access MultiCC from the public internet?

Use the **Tunnel** section in `/manage` → toggle **Tailscale Funnel** (requires Tailscale installed and authenticated). For 花生壳 DDNS users, the tunnel monitor keeps the phtunnel process alive.

### tmux sessions pile up

Terminal-mode sessions are named `multicc-<id>`. To clean up orphans:

```bash
tmux list-sessions | grep multicc | cut -d: -f1 | xargs -I{} tmux kill-session -t {}
```

### Port is already in use

MultiCC auto-selects the next available port if the configured one is occupied. Check the startup log for the actual port in use, or set a different `PORT` in `.env`.

### How do I share a chat conversation?

In the chat page, select messages and click "Share" — you'll get a read-only link. You can optionally set a password and allow viewers to operate. Shares are revoked when you delete the session.

### I upgraded from WebCC — what changed?

The rename changed persistence keys (`webcc_*` → `multicc_*`) and Android/iOS package identifiers (`com.webcc.*` → `com.multicc.*`):

- **Web UI:** you'll get logged out once; notification/voice toggles reset to defaults.
- **Flutter app:** install as a **new app** (old one stays side-by-side until you uninstall it). Setup screen asks for host / token / session again.
- **launchd service:** `./webcc uninstall` first, then `./multicc install` — the `Label` changed from `com.webcc.server` to `com.multicc.server`.
- **tmux sessions** named `webcc-*` are orphaned; kill with the command above (substituting `webcc`).

### How do I add a Telegram / Discord / Slack bridge?

In `/manage` → Bridges section, select the platform, enter your bot token or app credentials, create a gateway session, then start. Each bridge runs its own gateway session and supports the same dispatch + reply flow as WeChat/Feishu.
